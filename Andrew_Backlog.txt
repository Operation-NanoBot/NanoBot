8/4/17:
-Worked in "Side_Scrolling_Scene".
-Scaled down the player object, water bottle, and area aggressor by half.
-Camera set to 1024x768.
-Background image size is 7680x4800.
-Need a standardized sprite size for player object to determine size of screen resolution, 
pathways, platforms, and overall spread of the levels.
-Starting a list of environmental assets for Atiya:
	Edge borders (Top, side, bottom) to cut off player camera from catching edge of the background.
	Long, medium, short versions of each.
-Added sorting layers to be used in sprite rendering.
-Note: Player object passes through anything in the default layer. Be sure to apply platform layers
to environment objects.
-Arranged environment objects into a rough level layout, which will change with each pass as newer
assets get added. Will continuously be a WIP.
-Added a DUG placeholder sprite, also needs a standard sprite size.
-Note: Nurdles spawn behind the background. Possible sorting layer issue or culling mask with main camera
