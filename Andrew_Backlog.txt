9/5/17:
-Worked in "3_SideScroll_Scene_Arted".
-Created large map borders and enlarged the background to obscure edges of the environment.
-Bug Fix: Imported higher res character sprite, readjusted player mechanics offsetting.
-Deleted graybox prefabs from scene, but the files remain in their respective folders.
-Turned on additional Garbage Generators and Area Aggressors.
-Bug report: Player bullet passes through environment. Should destroy on collision.

9/1/17:
-Created a new scene, named it "3_SideScroll_Scene_Arted" and renamed the previous "3_SideScroll_Scene_Graybox".
-Imported Atiya's art assets and assembled level based on graybox design.
-Level now has environment assets.
-Additional folders made in the Resources folder named "Environment" and "Garbage".
-Additional garbage items imported and prefabbed, ready to be scripted in the garbage generator.
-Swapped player character sprite with updated art asset.
-Bug report: In swapping the player character sprite, I had to break the prefab. Controls still work, but the player's shoot and net ability
are offset. They now instantiate away from the player to the sides of the screen in whichever direction the player faces.

8/28/17:
-Redid previous changes in a new branch on GitHub.
-Worked in "3_SideScroll_Scene_1"
-Resized player and enemy by half. Nanobot_SideScroll and Area_Aggressor scale is now 0.5, 0.5, 1.
-Duplicated enemies and garbage spawn points to test the graybox map
-Bug report: Player's shot goes through platforms
-Bug report: Too much garbage accumulation can interfere with enemy detecting the player.



8/26/17:
-Worked in "Side_Scrolling_Scene", renamed it to "Level_1-1_Surface".
-Removed DUG and Area_Aggressor from the scene.
-Changed Main Camera projection from Orthographic to Perspective. This enables the camera to be pulled back along the
Z axis to capture more of the level on the player's screen.
-Updated "Camera Follow" script, default Z distance is now -20.0f.
-Created graybox units based on asset list items, imported into a new "Graybox" folder.
-Created a surface tile for the background.
-All graybox objects are prefixed with a "g" for searchability.
-Created a "Materials" folder. Added Grey material.
-Added a new layer called "Invisible".
-Set Dive Spots to Invisible layer.
-Set the Main Camera Culling Mask to ignore the Invisible layer.



8/4/17:
-Worked in "Side_Scrolling_Scene".
-Scaled down the player object, water bottle, and area aggressor by half.
-Camera set to 1024x768.
-Background image size is 7680x4800.
-Need a standardized sprite size for player object to determine size of screen resolution, 
pathways, platforms, and overall spread of the levels.
-Starting a list of environmental assets for Atiya:
	Edge borders (Top, side, bottom) to cut off player camera from catching edge of the background.
	Long, medium, short versions of each.
-Added sorting layers to be used in sprite rendering.
-Note: Player object passes through anything in the default layer. Be sure to apply platform layers
to environment objects.
-Arranged environment objects into a rough level layout, which will change with each pass as newer
assets get added. Will continuously be a WIP.
-Added a DUG placeholder sprite, also needs a standard sprite size.
-Note: Nurdles spawn behind the background. Possible sorting layer issue or culling mask with main camera
